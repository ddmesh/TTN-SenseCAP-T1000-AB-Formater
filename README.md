# TTN-SenseCAP-T1000-AB-Formater
A upload formater for TheThinksNetwork and the tracker card SenseCAP-T1000-AB

This script is a corrected and modified version of original SenseCAP formater which had some issues with
javascript version and not displaying location on TTN console.
It had also some bugs which where solved together with a little refactoring.

TTN uses JavaScript ECMAScript 5.1

There are two files, one that is still formated to be read it more easily. The other has spaces remove, because
the file size would be to big for TTN console (upload).

The formater should work with LowTrack App (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aeqweb.lowtrackapp).
